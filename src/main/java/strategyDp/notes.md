# Strategy Design Pattern
* best to implement open/closed principle
* implements DRY practice
* proves why composition is better than inheritance
* solution to inheritance is not more inheritance but composition
* if we keep on solving the problem of inheritance using more inherited classes, we would get into an infinite loop of inheritance everytime a new feature is added in our program
