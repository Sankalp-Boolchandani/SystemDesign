# Observer Design Pattern
- Observer design pattern is a behavioural design pattern and is not focused on the creation of objects.
- Rather more on the behaviour and how objects communicate with each other.
- Observer DP includes a subject and observers. Observers observe the subject and its changes.
- In our example, we are taking a yt channel as a subject and subscribers as observers.
- when a video is added to the yt channel, all its subscribers are sent a notification.
